Connect to the Server
=====================

Once your server is open on a port, you can connect to it using a Minecraft client.

For the sake of demonstration, we will assume you are running your server locally on port :code:`25565`.

1. Click on the **Multiplayer** button in the Minecraft main menu.
2. Click on **Add Server**.
3. Fill in a server name, and then set the **Server Address** to :code:`localhost:25565`. It should look something
   like this:

    .. image:: add_server_dialog.png
        :scale: 50 %

4. Click on **Done**. Your server should now appear in your server list.

    .. note::

        Sometimes, your server will show as unavailable ("`Can't connect to server`") after you add it to the server list.

        If that is the case, click on **Refresh**, and it should be live.

5. Select your server in the list, and click on **Join Server**. After a few seconds, you should spawn in your server's
world.
