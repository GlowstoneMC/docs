Plugins
=======

Most Bukkit_, Spigot_ and Paper_ plugins will work on Glowstone.

As you would with a CraftBukkit server, place the plugin :code:`.jar` files inside the :code:`plugins` directory.

.. warning::

    Plugins that use internals for Paper, Spigot, CraftBukkit, or Minecraft will not work, unless they are designed to fail gracefully.

    This includes plugins that use "*NMS*" reflectively.
