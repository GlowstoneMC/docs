If you have any trouble setting up, we would be happy to help you on the forums_
or Discord_.

* If you can't access your server from your public IP, make sure you have `port forwarded`_ or used a UPnP port mapper to allow incoming connections to your server.
* For server issues or suggestions, create an issue on Github.
* By default, all configuration files are in the :code:`config` folder.
