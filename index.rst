Welcome to the Glowstone documentation!

Glowstone is a fast, customizable and compatible open source Minecraft_ server written in Java that supports plugins for Bukkit_, as continued by Spigot_ and Paper_.
Glowstone's code is completely from scratch, so some Bukkit plugins that use Mojang code will not work, though.

This documentation introduces Glowstone for server owners and developers. If you are someone that plays on a server powered by Glowstone, you may find `our website`_ more interesting.

If you need help with something or if the documentation can't answer your question, you can chat with us via `our Discord server`_.
