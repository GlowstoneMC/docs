If I use Glowstone, do I still have to follow the EULA\?
---------------------------------------------------------

**Yes, you still have to follow the Minecraft EULA.**

Glowstone is a Minecraft server - that is to say, it implements the Minecraft protocol,
is designed to work with Minecraft clients, and allows users to play Minecraft with other users.
Anyone that plays Minecraft in any capacity or runs a service that works with Minecraft players
is required to follow the `Minecraft EULA`_. See *Blizzard v bnetd*.

If you feel that this is incorrect, we suggest that you seek professional legal counsel before inadvertently breaking the EULA.
